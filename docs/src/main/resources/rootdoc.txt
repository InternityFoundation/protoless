This is the API documentation for Protoless, a Protobuf library for Scala.

The main entry point to use protoless is the [[io.protoless.generic]] package object, which allow to derive
encoders and decoders for your case classes.

The library is split in several modules:
 - [[io.protoless]]: Syntax, decoding failures
 - [[io.protoless.messages messages]]: Encoder and Decoder for protobuf messages.
 - [[io.protoless.fields fields]]: Encoder and Decoder for protobuf fields.
 - [[io.protoless.generic generic]]: Shapeless-powered generic derivation for case classes.
 - [[io.protoless.tag tag]]: Tagging tools to support unsigned/signed/fixed types.

Please see the [[https://julien-lafont.github.io/protoless/ guide]] for more information on how to use protoless.
